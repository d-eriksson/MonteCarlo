- More control over the scene in GUI
  - Brightness
  - Materials?
  - Textures?
- Double check theory of light integration!!
  - Specifically the end of "if(glossy){...}" in RenderTask.java
  - Average brightness over all emitters(??) in RenderTask.java. This doesn't
    make sense because the same doesn't happen when rays spontaneously intersect
    emitters.
- Emitter sampling functions for spheres and env lights
- Environment texture
- Spiral render order
- UV-coordinate fix
  - Add function: Material.getuv()
