- Double check theory of light integration
  - Specifically end of if(glossy){...} in RenderTask.java
  - Average brightness over all emitters(??) in RenderTask.java. This doesn't
    make sense because the same doesn't happen when rays spontaneously intersect
    emitters.
- Possibility of arbitrary resolution
  - Including possibility of arbitrary aspect ratio
- Emitter sampling functions for spheres and env lights
- Environment texture
- Spiral render order
- Material.getuv
